This version of Nmdepend features generation of:

-package dependency graph
-object dependency graph (where objects are clustered in packages)
-include dependency graph

Nmdepend can be used for any C or C++ project as long as it can be
compiled to object files (except for the include dependencies).

Building:

Nmdepend requires:

-cmake              (http://www.cmake.org)
-(gnu) make         (http://www.gnu.org/software/make)
-(gnu) c++ compiler (http://gcc.gnu.org or http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc)
-boost              (http://www.boost.org)
-commonc++2         (http://www.gnu.org/software/commoncpp)

Build and install the required tools and libraries according to their individual
descriptions.

Building nmdepend

mkdir build
cd build
cmake . nmdepend_top_directory
make

Running:

Nmdepend can be run to search source for include dependencies using the -i
commandline option or search object files for link dependencies using the -o
commandline option.

Both options require the top directory of the project you want to analyse.
For example having built Nmdepend you can generate the graphs by:

./depend -o . 1>object.dot 2>package.dot
./depend -i . 1>include.dot

As you can see the link dependencies generated with the -o option are written to
stdout and the link dependencies between packages are written to stderr.

To render the graphs you require dot or dotty from the Graphviz
(http://www.graphviz.org) project.
